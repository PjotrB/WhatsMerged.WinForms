# WhatsMerged.WinForms
A Windows Forms (.NET) front-end for showing a branch-by-branch "What's been merged" overview of any GIT project that you have access to.

Works best with projects for which work is typically done in `feature/xyz` branches + (optionally) `bugfix/xyz` and/or `hotfix/xyz` branches, which are then merged into branches with common names such as `develop`, `test`, `release` (or `release/1.1`, `release/1.2`, etc) and finally `master`.
